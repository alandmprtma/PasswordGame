# üîê The Password Game
## Application Description
### Overview
My Password Game application is an engaging and challenging game designed to test users' skills in creating secure and compliant passwords. The game progressively introduces rules that the user's password must satisfy. Utilizing advanced pattern matching algorithms such as regex, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Boyer-Moore (BM), this game provides a comprehensive and educational experience in password creation.

### Game Mechanics
1. <b>Incremental Rule Application:</b> Each rule is introduced one after the other as the player meets the previous rule. If a password does not comply with the active rules, a message is displayed highlighting the specific error.
2. <b>Error Highlighting:</b> Incorrect characters in the password are highlighted in red to indicate the exact location of the mistake.

### Rules
1. <b>Minimum Length:</b> The password must be at least X characters long.
2. <b>Numeric Inclusion:</b> The password must include at least one number.
3. <b>Uppercase Letter:</b> The password must include at least one uppercase letter.
4. <b>Special Character:</b> The password must include at least one special character.
5. <b>Digit Sum:</b> The digits in the password must add up to X.
6. <b>Month Inclusion:</b> The password must include the name of a month.
7. <b>Roman Numeral:</b> The password must include a Roman numeral.
8. <b>Country Flag:</b> The password must include one of the displayed country flags (10 flags in total, X displayed per session).
9. <b>Roman Numeral Product:</b> The Roman numerals in the password should multiply to X.
10. <b>Fire Emoji:</b> A fire emoji will burn (delete) one letter every X seconds starting from the end until all are replaced by fire emojis. Random reappearance of fire emojis requires the player to remove them continuously.
11. <b>Egg Emoji:</b> An egg emoji must be included and remain un-deleted in the password. Deleting it results in a loss.
12. <b>CAPTCHA Inclusion:</b> The password must include a correct CAPTCHA image from a set of seven, refreshed upon request.
13. <b>Leap Year:</b> The password must include a leap year.
14. <b>Chicken Emoji:</b> The egg emoji hatches into a chicken emoji, and the player must include at least Y worm emojis every X seconds. Failing to do so results in a loss.
15. <b>Letter Sacrifice:</b> The player must choose X letters that cannot be used in the password.
16. <b>Specific Phrases:</b> The password must contain one of the following phrases: "I want IRK," "I need IRK," or "I love IRK."
17. <b>Digit Percentage:</b> At least X% of the password must be digits.
18. <b>Password Length:</b> The password must include its own length.
19. <b>Prime Length:</b> The length of the password must be a prime number.
20. <b>Current Time:</b> The password must include the current time.


### Special Features
- <b>Cheat Command:</b> Typing "cheat" provides an automatic correct solution for all active rules, continuing the existing password.
- <b>Scoring System:</b> Scores are based on time, password quality, or a combination. Scores are updated in real-time and the final score is displayed along with the highest score achieved.
- <b>Difficulty Levels:</b> Three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with distinct and significant differences in challenges. Variable parameters like X and Y are adjusted to increase difficulty.

### Winning and Losing Condition
Players win by satisfying all 20 rules. They lose if they fail to meet the criteria of any rule, especially unique ones like the egg/chicken emoji conditions. This Password Game application is designed to provide an educational yet entertaining experience, helping users understand the importance of secure password practices while engaging in a fun challenge.
